## Hello 🌍!

My name is Jacques and this is my blog.

Most of my content will center around programming and other tech related topics.

I’m currently re-learning Java and I’ve started learning functional programming as well. Hopefully in the future I will start learning Scala.

 ``` java
 System.out.println("hello world!");
 ```

Thanks for reading.
